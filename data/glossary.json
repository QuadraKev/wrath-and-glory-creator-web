For the remainder of the Scene, you roll an extra Wrath Die on all Tests. You roll a second extra Wrath Die on Investigation (Int), Psychic Mastery (Wil), and Scholar (Int) Tests. Whilst using these extra Wrath Dice, you achieve a Wrath Critical if you score an Exalted Icon on any Wrath Dice in your pool, unless you are Dying or making a Test where Wrath Criticals are not possible. However, any Complications rolled trigger a Perils of the Warp effect. In addition, you may beseech the Changer of the Ways to answer a single question about the future. Compared to uses of the Prescience power, the GM's response is likely to be much more detailed and vivid than a short phrase or emotion. However, this flood of forbidden knowledge is often horrifying or destabilising, perhaps requiring a Resolve Test to resist Fear, or a Conviction Test to resist Corruption. Casting Gaze of Fate automatically triggers a Perils of the Warp effect. Add +10 to the roll on the Perils of the Warp table for each Complication rolled as part of the Psychic Mastery (Wil) Test. You may only cast Gaze of Fate once per scene.<br><br><b>Potency:</b> [1] Activation reduced by 5 minutes (minimum 5).\n*[2] You may ask the GM an additional question about the future."
