When you fire or throw a Blast weapon, choose any point in range (including another character!), then make a DN 3 Ballistic Skill (A) Test. Apply Range effects as normal unless you are using a thrown weapon like a grenade. If you fail the Test, the attack misses and Scatters. If you succeed, the explosion is centered on your target. If you are measuring distance, the Blast rating determines the radius of the explosion in metres. Anyone inside this radius is hit by the attack. If you are targeting a Mob, the number of individuals in the Mob hit by the explosion is equal to half of the Blast rating. If you are using a theater of the mind approach, you can use this number as a shorthand to determine how many proximate targets are hit — the GM might decide a Frag Grenade hits 3 Cultists charging through the grand hall of an abbey, rather than applying the radius of the explosion. You cannot Shift to increase the damage of a Blast weapon. If you inflict a Critical Hit with a Blast weapon, the effects apply to all targets hit by the attack."
