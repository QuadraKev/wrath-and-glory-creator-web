By opening your mind, you receive echoes of the past psychically emanating from a place or an object. When you use this power you are able to glimpse visions of past events in an area where an individual expressed an emotional outburst. Initially, only the psychic traces of the specific emotion enter your senses. The longer you remain in place and sustain the power, the more information you receive about the events surrounding the emotional outburst. Your senses can detect past events that happen in a 10m diameter sphere centred on yourself. 1 Hour: Though vague and indistinct, your senses can perceive the events immediately preceding, during, and after the emotional outburst. Individuals appear ghostly with impermanent, hazy forms, and all sounds are muffled, echoing whispers. 6 Hours: You can perceive the events preceding, during, and after the emotional outburst within range in clear focus. 12 Hours: You glean a deeper understanding of what took place from the Warp; you may ask the GM a single question about the event that took place. You can also use this psychic power on a specific object you are in physical contact with instead of a location. The nature of the visions you receive are the same, but the range of any visions is halved and centered on the object.<br><br><b>Potency:</b> [1] You may share your vision with any ally in range of the psychic power.

While Navigator powers are very much derived from the Warp, and Navigators count as PSYKERS in most regards, they are not quite the same as conventional psykers. Navigators differ from normal Psykers in the following ways: • A Navigator uses the Psychic Mastery skill with Intellect instead of Willpower. A Navigator’s powers derive from their unique ability to perceive the Warp. • Navigators do not select a power level when they use a Navigator Power. All of a Navigator’s powers are used at the Bound level. Navigators do not wield and direct the Warp as Psykers do. • Navigators do not suffer Perils of the Warp. Instead, a Wrath Complication on a Navigator Power inflicts 1d3+1 Shock but has no other effect. Some Navigator Powers are Gaze Powers. These rely on the Navigator revealing their warp eye to the target, unleashing the baleful light of the Immaterium. A target may try to avert their eyes from a gaze power as a Reflexive Action: this increases the DN of the power by +2, but the target suffers the Blinded condition until the end of their next turn as they cover their eyes.
