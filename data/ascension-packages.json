    "description": "The Ynnari are the members of a newly formed eponymous Eldar group that worship the God Ynnead and believe their race can be saved from the depredation of Slaanesh by helping to bring about the birth of the slumbering god of the dead. Under the leadership of the prophet Yvraine, the \"Daughter of Shades,\" the Ynnari seek to fully awaken the Aeldari god of the dead Ynnead, who they believe can defeat Slaanesh and restore the Aeldari species' unity and its lost glory. A great many Aeldari, hailing from every sub-faction and allegiance save the most conservative and entrenched, have joined their cause. No abstract philosophy is this, for the effects of their new deity can be seen manifesting around them -- the Reborn can draw upon the souls within the Spirit Stones they wear to bolster their own abilities, can siphon the power of those slain nearby to invigorate their attacks, and turn their foes to ashes with the strange weapons and psychic powers they wield.",

    "description": "The Adeptus Mechanicus are willing to go to almost any lengths to further their understanding of the arcane sciences they study. In the most extreme cases, some of the oldest Arch-Magi have long since become little more than artificially-sustained brains linked to vast meme-vaults and data-crypts, driven insane by possessing far more knowledge than any human mind can truly comprehend and willingly locked within a steel prison of their own design for centuries. For people such as these, the pursuit of knowledge is something worth paying any price for, and such a disembodied existence, basking in the purity of absolute and incalculable knowledge unfettered by the weaknesses of the flesh, is something that more than a few Tech-Priests aspire to. To discard all but the brain in the pursuit of knowledge is not as uncommon as it might seem. In many cases, two Tech-Priests working upon the same project have been known to enter into the deepest of collaborations, a process known as the Rite of Duplessence. This procedure requires that one of the two Tech-Priests shed his flesh and most of his implants to become a disembodied brain, which is then implanted into the body of the other Tech-Priest, their brains linked together so that they can work together more closely.",

From a young age, citizens of the Imperium are taught to fear and hate the xenos, and innumerable legions of Imperial Guardsmen are taught of the superiority of Man over all inhuman things as they are drilled in the use of lasgun and bayonet. The number of xenos who have set foot upon human worlds peacefully and survived is small indeed. But this is not always the case. Though the Imperium was founded upon a creed of intolerance towards non-humans, peaceful contact with a variety of xenos species actually happens frequently. In most instances, these are short-term alliances or matters of temporary mutual convenience. Rogue Traders, Inquisitors, and a few other individuals, have the power to do more, and do so legitimately. These men and women, freed from the normal strictures and feudal requirements of the Imperium, have the influence and authority to make peaceful contact with xenos species for trade, temporary alliance or even to hire them as mercenaries.",

    "description": "The induction of the Primaris Marines into the Adeptus Astartes was not an easy process by any means. The Chapters of the Space Marines are arch traditionalists, and some are conservative in the extreme, having upheld the same warrior traditions for thousands of Terran years. Of course, the express command of Roboute Guilliman as the Lord Commander of the Imperium eased the transition into the new era. For the Ultramarines and most of their Successor Chapters, the word of their risen Primarch was good enough, and many Chapters welcomed the Primaris Battle-Brothers gladly. But there were those especially secretive or wilful Chapters who saw the incorporation of the Primaris Marines into their ranks as a dilution of their gene-stock and a betrayal of their long-held culture. Some amongst the Adeptus Astartes suspected that the Primaris Marines, being stronger, more durable and closer in blood to the Primarchs themselves, represented the obsolescence of the traditional Astartes. The dilemma proved divisive. There were those who claimed that this was the ultimate destiny of all Adeptus Astartes, while from other quarters came whispers of rejection, even mutiny, at the prospect. You have chosen to follow this example, and survived the process, emerging anew with greater strength and vitality.",

    "description": "Daemonic Possession is the act of the essence of a Daemon possessing and controlling the body of another being. As Daemons can only exist in the Materium for a limited period before being forced back into the Warp, Daemonic Possession is one of the most common methods for Daemons to enter the material realm. Daemonic Possession can occur involuntarily to those of psychic potential, but the host sometimes willingly gives themselves over to Daemonic Possession, as is the case with Possessed Chaos Space Marines and certain Cultists. Possessed individuals can often be used as gateways to the Warp, allowing Daemons to spill into the Materium. A character selecting this Ascension Package has invited a daemon into their flesh, granting them tremendous power, at the cost of subjecting their body, mind, and soul to the ravening touch of the Warp. Few who become possessed can endure it for long, often finding their bodies degenerating into spawndom or becoming purely a vessel for the daemon's will, but some can find a degree of symbiosis with the daemon they are host to, becoming a singular mighty entity.",
